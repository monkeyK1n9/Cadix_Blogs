## What is CADiX ?

Another tech product ? If you are here, reading this, it is surely because you are a slave.
You are constantly looking for the next tech product which can help you accomplish a task.
You are **hooked**, using more than 5 software to design, build, collaborate and monitor your next construction project.
You are a **product slave**, bound to pay huge amounts for licenses.
We have been there too, and that is why we bring CADiX.

### Where it all started
John is an Architect and just got a new client, a friend to his father, Michael, wishing to build a new house.
Michael is a dreamer and wishes to have great house, but also an easy way to get there, a smooth construction
experience. John builds a team, his civil engineer Paul, an MEP expert, Albert and few juniors.
Maintaining different plan versions is not an easy task. Soon enough, communication becomes a problem. Working on different software,
doesn't offer the team a centralized solution to have a global overview of the project.
The client, Michael, is lost, despleased by the services of John and may surely draw away the contract.

### What CADiX brings to the table

Don't be a slave anymore, here comes CADiX. CADiX means Computer Assisted Design and Information eXchange. CADiX provides:
- A unified environment to permit the client, designers, architects, engineers and any team member to have
a global overview and contribution to the project.
- A versioning system for the project
- A messaging system for each team to collaborate effectively
- 3D environment to visualize and edit the plan

### Roadmap

We have a plan and we are getting there:
- ✅ Blog post
- ⬜️ Project creation
- ⬜️ Versioning system
- ⬜️ Messaging
- ⬜️ Project visualization and editing
- ⬜️ Reporting and construction follow-up
- ⬜️ Project planning

### Conclusion

CADiX is a open attempt to free John from his slavery, to offer a solution that is different and really changes
his approach to project design, planning and management. We hope you love what we are building. Contact us to
if you have any questions, or suggestions.
